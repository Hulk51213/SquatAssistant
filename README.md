# RepRight 
AI-Powered Exercise Form & Rep Detection using Google MediaPipe

---

## Overview
**RepRight** is a real-time computer vision fitness assistant that analyzes squat form and counts repetitions using a standard webcam.  
It provides instant visual and audio feedback to help users maintain proper form and reduce injury risk — all without wearable devices.

---

##  Key Features
- Real-time squat rep counting  
- Full-body pose detection  
- Spine alignment & posture validation  
- Form stability smoothing (no flicker)  
- Desktop UI with instant feedback  
- Runs fully offline (privacy-friendly)

---

## How It Works
RepRight uses **Google MediaPipe Pose** to extract 33 human body landmarks per frame.

From these landmarks, the system:
- Computes knee joint angles to detect squat depth
- Analyzes torso (spine) angle for posture correctness
- Applies temporal smoothing to stabilize predictions
- Uses a state machine to reliably count full reps
